  <h1>My CV</h1>
  <p>My name is Vnukovskiy Dmitriy
  My Email for communication vnukovskiy.dmitriy@gmail.com
He studied in the specialty ASOIiU (*Automated information processing and control systems*) at a construction college. After studying at the technical school, he worked for a local provider in the VU department (*service implementation department*) - he was engaged in installing and configuring the connection of network devices, as well as eliminating problems in the operation of computers.
Then he left for another job, where he got a job as a system administrator in a large company with a staff of about 1,500 computers - he was engaged in connecting computers, setting up computers and accounts in AD (*Active Directory*), distributing access rights, and supporting users when working with systems. A year and a half later, in the same company, he moved to the position of a network administrator - where he was engaged in setting up network equipment (switches, routers, video cameras and network recorders), entered into and conducted dialogues with providers, monitored network devices at remote points, and also set up between branches GRE - tunnels, OSPF, routing.

In my free time, as a hobby, I am engaged in 3D printing of plastic products on 3D printers (*I have at my disposal 3 pieces of equipment*) - one of which I built myself. In addition, I am engaged in microcomputers (*Raspberry PI, Orange PI*) and microcontrollers *(Arduino, NodeMCU*) - things with 3D printing are interconnected since one of the printers is controlled via the Web interface on OrangePI.

I decided to go into programming because I want to learn something new and have always shown interest in programming. From knowledge of programming languages only basic, even from the training course .... I know superficially html, css, delphi, php, mysql, c ++.
No experience with programming, English is at the level of reading technical documentation.</p>
